# User API Dev Guide

## Building
Front-end application - Simply run
- npm i, then
- npm start

## Testing
For the back-end Web Api,
Execute update-databse in NuGet package manager in order to generate DB tables
Then simply run start/build the project in VS, this should seed the database table with User data.
NOTE: no accounts are generated as part of this seeding. This will need to be done afterwards.

Unit Testing is limited to back-end code and only covers the relevant services
